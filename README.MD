### Aout

Use this script to securely wipe your disk.

This script monitors the disk usage of the parent directory of the current working directory. It continuously writes the contents of a file named `secure-random` into a file called `trash` in the current directory until the disk usage reaches 95%. After reaching the threshold, the `trash` file is deleted.

`secure-random` takes 10 MB. It is generated by my self-made PRNG, which is randomly composed of all printable ASCIIs. Feel free to replace it with your version.

### Requirements

- Bash

### Instructions

1. Put `disk-wiper/` in the root directory of the disk.
2. Open your file manager, navigate into the `disk-wiper/` folder.
3. Right-click on any blank space inside `disk-wiper/` and select "Open in Terminal".
4. Run the script with `$ ./run.sh`.

## Warning

Because `secure-random` and `trash` files can be large, **only** view them using the `nano` editor in the terminal to avoid potential crashes caused by opening large files in heavier editors or file viewers.
