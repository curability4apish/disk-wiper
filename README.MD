### About

Use this script to securely wipe your disk.

This script monitors the disk usage while wiping it. It continuously writes the contents of a file named `secure-random` into a file called `trash` in the current directory until the disk usage reaches 95%. After reaching the threshold, the `trash` file is deleted.

`secure-random` takes 10 MB. It is generated by my self-made PRNG, which is randomly composed of all printable ASCIIs. Feel free to replace it with your version.

### Requirements

A device that can be plugged in the disk to wipe, and that device should have the ability to execute bash.

The file system of that disk should support large files. For example, FAT is not supported.



### Instructions

1. Put `disk-wiper/` in the root directory of the disk.
2. Open your file manager, navigate into the `disk-wiper/` folder.
3. Right-click on any blank space inside `disk-wiper/` and select "Open in Terminal".
4. Run the script with `$ bash ./run.sh`.

## Warning

Because `secure-random` and `trash` files can be large, **only** view them using the `nano` editor in the terminal to avoid potential crashes caused by opening large files in heavier editors or file viewers.
